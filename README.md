> A life-saving digital credential system for Dynamic Scoliosis practitioners and patient emergency records

Professional healthcare infrastructure enabling physicians worldwide to establish verifiable Dynamic Scoliosis credentials on blockchain while providing emergency responders instant access to critical patient information via QR codes.

## 🚨 CRITICAL: This Can Save Lives

**For Emergency Responders:** Patient QR codes contain vital medical information including:
- **Blood type and allergies** - Critical for immediate treatment decisions
- **Current medications** - Prevents dangerous drug interactions  
- **Medical devices** - Alerts to pacemakers, implants, or scoliosis braces
- **Emergency contacts** - Immediate family notification
- **Primary physician** - Expert consultation access

**For Healthcare Providers:** Verifiable credentials establish trust and expertise in Dynamic Scoliosis treatment, enabling:
- **Cross-border practice** - International credential verification
- **Patient confidence** - Verified training and specialization levels
- **Insurance acceptance** - Documented certification for coverage
- **Emergency treatment** - Quick verification of treating physician qualifications

## Quick Start Guide

### Installation

```bash
# Install from source
git clone https://github.com/Frajder/dynamic_scoliosis.git
cd dynamic_scoliosis
pip install -e .
```

### Generate Your First Credential

```bash
# Interactive mode (recommended for first-time users)
ds-credentials generate

# Quick practitioner credential
ds-credentials generate \
  --type practitioner \
  --name "Dr. Kim Johnson" \
  --issuer "did:web:kim-clinic.example"

# Patient emergency record
ds-credentials generate \
  --type patient_record \
  --name "Kim Johnson" \
  --issuer "did:web:hospital.example"
```

### Validate & View Credentials

```bash
# Validate a credential
ds-credentials validate output/credential.json

# View credential summary
ds-credentials summary output/credential.json

# Decode QR code payload
ds-credentials decode-qr "VC:eyJhbGciOiJFZE..."
```

## Life-Saving Use Cases

### Case 1: Emergency Room Response

**Scenario:** Kim Johnson, a Dynamic Scoliosis patient, is brought unconscious to the ER after a car accident.

**Life-Saving Action:** 
1. EMT scans QR code on Kim's medical bracelet
2. Instantly reveals: **Blood type B+**, **Codeine allergy**, **Scoliosis brace**
3. Prevents life-threatening allergic reaction to standard pain medication
4. Alerts surgeon to spinal hardware before procedures

**Implementation:**
```bash
# Generate emergency patient record
ds-credentials generate \
  --type medical_alert \
  --config emergency_config.json
```

### Case 2: Physician Credential Verification

**Scenario:** Dr. Kim establishes Dynamic Scoliosis practice after relocating internationally.

**Professional Success:**
1. Generates verifiable W3C credential proving medical training
2. Blockchain-based verification prevents credential fraud
3. Insurance companies accept verified training documentation
4. Patients trust demonstrated expertise levels

**Implementation:**
```bash
# Generate practitioner credential
ds-credentials generate \
  --type practitioner \
  --config kim_practitioner.json \
  --qr
```

### Case 3: Cross-Border Medical Consultation

**Scenario:** Emergency scoliosis case requires expert consultation across time zones.

**Medical Collaboration:**
1. Local physician scans patient QR code for complete medical history
2. Shares verifiable credential proving Dynamic Scoliosis specialization  
3. Specialist validates credentials via blockchain verification
4. Secure consultation proceeds with verified expertise confirmation
