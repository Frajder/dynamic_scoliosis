## Reporting a Vulnerability

**CRITICAL:** This system handles life-saving medical information. Security vulnerabilities could directly impact patient safety.

### Security Contact

Report security vulnerabilities by opening a GitHub issue with the **security** label. For sensitive security issues, you can also create a private issue.

**Response Time:**
- Critical vulnerabilities: Within 24 hours
- High priority vulnerabilities: Within 48 hours  
- Medium/Low priority: Within 1 week

### What to Include

When reporting a security vulnerability, please include:

1. **Description** of the vulnerability
2. **Steps to reproduce** the issue
3. **Potential impact** on patient safety or data privacy
4. **Suggested fix** (if you have one)
5. **Your contact information** for follow-up

### Security Scope

#### In Scope
- **Medical data exposure** in QR codes or credentials
- **Credential forgery** or tampering vulnerabilities
- **Authentication bypass** in DID verification
- **Information disclosure** of patient data
- **CLI security issues** that could expose sensitive data
- **Cryptographic weaknesses** in signature generation/verification

#### Out of Scope
- **Social engineering** attacks
- **Physical device security** (smartphones, bracelets)
- **Network-level attacks** (unless specific to this application)
- **Third-party service vulnerabilities** (unless integration-specific)

## Security Considerations

### Medical Data Protection

#### Patient Privacy
- **Minimize data exposure**: Only include essential emergency information in QR codes
- **Use compression**: Reduces QR code size and limits data exposure
- **Implement selective disclosure**: Share only necessary information per use case
- **Regular data review**: Ensure QR codes contain current, relevant information only

#### Emergency Access Controls
```python
# Example: Log emergency access for audit trails
def emergency_access_log(responder_id, patient_qr_hash, actions_taken):
    """Log emergency QR code access for compliance."""
    return {
        "timestamp": datetime.now(timezone.utc),
        "responder_id": responder_id,
        "patient_qr_hash": sha256(patient_qr_hash).hexdigest(),
        "actions_taken": actions_taken,
        "justification": "life_threatening_emergency"
    }
```

### Cryptographic Security

#### Digital Signatures
**Current Implementation:**
- Demo signatures for testing (`eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSJ9..demo-signature`)
- Ed25519 signature algorithm support
- DID-based verification methods

**Production Requirements:**
```python
# REQUIRED: Implement real signature generation
def generate_production_signature(credential_data, private_key):
    """Generate real Ed25519 signature for production use."""
    # TODO: Replace demo signature with actual cryptographic signing
    # Use ed25519 library or similar for real signatures
    pass

# REQUIRED: Implement signature verification  
def verify_signature(credential, public_key):
    """Verify Ed25519 signature against public key."""
    # TODO: Implement actual signature verification
    # Critical for preventing credential forgery
    pass
```

#### Key Management
**Security Requirements:**
- **Private keys**: Store securely, never in code or config files
- **Key rotation**: Implement regular key rotation policies
- **Hardware security modules**: Consider HSM for high-security deployments
- **Multi-signature**: Consider multi-sig for critical medical institutions

### DID Security

#### DID Resolution
```python
# Example: Secure DID resolution with caching and validation
def resolve_did_securely(did_string):
    """Resolve DID with security validations."""
    # Validate DID format
    if not did_string.startswith('did:'):
        raise SecurityError("Invalid DID format")
    
    # Implement caching to prevent DoS via resolution
    # Validate DID document integrity
    # Check for known malicious DIDs
    pass
```

#### Verification Methods
- **HTTPS enforcement**: All DID resolution over secure connections
- **Certificate validation**: Verify SSL certificates for web-based DIDs
- **Timeout protection**: Prevent DoS via slow DID resolution
- **Caching strategy**: Balance security with performance

### QR Code Security

#### Data Minimization
```python
# Example: Minimize data in emergency QR codes
def create_emergency_qr_data(patient_record):
    """Create minimal QR data for emergencies."""
    return {
        "blood_type": patient_record.blood_type,
        "critical_allergies": patient_record.critical_allergies[:3],  # Limit
        "emergency_contact": patient_record.primary_emergency_contact,
        "medical_alerts": [alert for alert in patient_record.medical_alerts 
                          if alert.severity == "critical"][:2]  # Limit
    }
```

#### QR Code Validation
- **Size limits**: Prevent excessively large QR codes
- **Content validation**: Sanitize all input data
- **Format verification**: Ensure proper VC: prefix and base64 encoding
- **Compression safety**: Validate decompressed data size

### Network Security

#### Data in Transit
- **HTTPS required**: All credential transmission over encrypted connections
- **Certificate pinning**: Pin certificates for critical services
- **Request validation**: Validate all incoming requests
- **Rate limiting**: Prevent abuse of credential generation endpoints

#### API Security
```python
# Example: Rate limiting for credential generation
from functools import wraps
import time

def rate_limit(max_calls=10, time_window=60):
    """Rate limit credential generation to prevent abuse."""
    def decorator(func):
        calls = {}
        @wraps(func)
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            now = time.time()
            # Implement rate limiting logic
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return decorator

@rate_limit(max_calls=5, time_window=300)  # 5 credentials per 5 minutes
def generate_credential_api(config):
    """API endpoint with rate limiting."""
    pass
```

### Deployment Security

#### Production Checklist
- [ ] **Replace demo signatures** with real cryptographic keys
- [ ] **Implement DID resolution** with proper validation
- [ ] **Set up key management** system (HSM recommended)
- [ ] **Configure HTTPS** for all endpoints
- [ ] **Enable audit logging** for all credential operations
- [ ] **Implement rate limiting** on credential generation
- [ ] **Set up monitoring** for suspicious activity
- [ ] **Regular security updates** for all dependencies

#### Environment Security
```bash
# Example: Secure environment configuration
export CREDENTIAL_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH="/secure/path/to/private.key"
export DID_RESOLVER_URL="https://secure-resolver.example.com"
export ENABLE_AUDIT_LOGGING="true"
export MAX_QR_SIZE_BYTES="2048"
```

### Compliance Considerations

#### HIPAA Compliance
- **Access controls**: Implement role-based access to patient data
- **Audit trails**: Log all access to patient credentials
- **Data minimization**: Only include necessary medical information
- **Encryption**: Encrypt data at rest and in transit
- **Training**: Ensure staff understand HIPAA requirements

#### GDPR Compliance
- **Data subject rights**: Implement credential revocation/update mechanisms
- **Privacy by design**: Minimize data collection and processing
- **Consent management**: Ensure patient consent for credential creation
- **Data portability**: Support credential export in standard formats

### Incident Response

#### Security Incident Classification
1. **Critical**: Patient safety at risk, credential compromise
2. **High**: Unauthorized access to patient data
3. **Medium**: System availability issues
4. **Low**: Non-sensitive configuration issues

#### Response Procedures
1. **Immediate containment**: Isolate affected systems
2. **Assessment**: Determine scope and impact
3. **Notification**: Alert relevant stakeholders
4. **Remediation**: Fix vulnerabilities and restore service
5. **Post-incident review**: Learn and improve security

### Secure Development Practices

#### Code Security
- **Input validation**: Validate all user inputs and configuration
- **Output encoding**: Properly encode all outputs
- **Error handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in errors
- **Dependency management**: Keep dependencies updated and secure

#### Testing Security
```python
# Example: Security test for QR code size limits
def test_qr_code_size_limit():
    """Test that QR codes reject oversized payloads."""
    large_payload = "x" * 10000  # 10KB payload
    qr_generator = QRGenerator()
    
    with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="Payload too large"):
        qr_generator.encode_credential_for_qr({"data": large_payload})
```
